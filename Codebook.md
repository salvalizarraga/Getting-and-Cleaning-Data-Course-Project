The following codebook describe the file in tidy_data.txt:

Column 1: Subject. The ID of the subject. There are 30 subjects between 18-48 years. 
Column 2: Activity: the type of activities performed by each of the 30 subjects. A total of six activities which included:
•	Walking
•	Walking upstairs
•	Walking downstairs
•	Sitting
•	Standing
•	Laying

Columns 3-66: Contains the average of the mean and standard deviation by subject (column 1) and activity (column 2) for each of the measurements performed. 

The measurement included time domain and frequency domain for the following variables for three axial signals (x, y and z):
•	Body Acceleration
•	Gravity Acceleration
•	Body Acceleration Jerk
•	Body Angular Speed
•	Body Angular Acceleration
•	Body Acceleration Magnitude
•	Gravity Acceleration Magnitude
•	Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
•	Body Angular Speed Magnitude
•	Body Angular Acceleration Magnitude
•	Body Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
•	Body Body Angular Speed Magnitude
•	Body Body Angular Acceleration Magnitude
